    Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

    This project was a clock project that helped practice conditionals and also how code operates. We created a clock to display time, and add seconds, minutes, and hours.

    What did you do particularly well?

    What I did well was understanding the time. I did a good job with formatting the time and adding time.
    
    Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

    I could enhance my code by making the menus better and also have a better UI. I think the way the project is, is good to start but then needs to be built upon to make it better.
    
    Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

    The most challenging was the menus. I think what made it hard was that the directions seemed unclear to me. How I worked it was I kept trying to read the messages after.
    Those helped some of the time.
    
    What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

    The logic of code will always be. I believe the way of doing conditionals and variables barely changes too much. As long as you can understand what the code is doing thing you can apply it to other languages and also use the same concepts/algorithms.

    How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Did not as of yet.
